You are Replit AI helping to verify and test a Django web project named “Our Voice, Our Rights” — built for the “Take Home Project: Our Voice, Our Rights” assignment.

🔹 Project Objective:
The website should make MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) data accessible and easy to understand for common citizens of rural India, especially from the selected state — **Maharashtra**.

The project should:
- Fetch data from the Government of India’s Open API for MGNREGA (https://www.data.gov.in/catalog/mahatma-gandhi-national-rural-employment-guarantee-act-mgnrega)
- Let users select their **District** within Maharashtra.
- Display current and past performance, comparisons, and summaries in a simple, visual, easy-to-read manner.
- Cache or store API data locally so the website works even if the API is down or rate-limited.
- Have an intuitive, mobile-friendly interface for low-literacy users (icons, visuals, simple text).
- Be ready for large-scale use (production-level structure).

Bonus functionality (optional but appreciated):
- Detect user’s district automatically based on their location (geolocation).
- Include visual performance indicators (charts, comparisons, etc.)

🔹 Tech Requirements:
- Built in **Django** (not Flask).
- Default state: **Maharashtra**.
- Should use local caching or a database to avoid API downtime.
- Interface must be simple, readable, and mobile-accessible.
- Must run properly in **Replit** environment.
- Must have proper configuration for:
  - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
  - `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
  - `STATIC_URL` setup
  - Database migrations and management

🔹 Your task:
1. **Check every file in this Replit project**, including:
   - `/django_project/settings.py`
   - `/django_project/urls.py`
   - `app/views.py`
   - `app/models.py`
   - `app/templates/*`
   - Any static or JavaScript files
2. Verify that all required functionalities listed above exist and are implemented correctly.
3. Ensure there are no missing imports, syntax errors, broken links, or incorrect configurations.
4. Check if Maharashtra is correctly set as the default state for district selection.
5. Validate that caching or fallback data handling is present (for when API is unavailable).
6. Confirm that the interface is simple, readable, and usable on mobile.
7. Run and test endpoints to make sure all pages render correctly and fetch the right data.

If anything is missing, incorrect, or not working, automatically fix it or clearly describe what needs to be changed (with correct Django code suggestions).

Finally, verify that the project can be successfully run in Replit using:
